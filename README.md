# Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI

A Flutter implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game featuring an **unbeatable AI opponent** powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

## 🧠 The Unbeatable AI

### **Challenge Accepted: Try to Beat the Computer!**

This isn't your typical tic-tac-toe game. The computer opponent uses a **mathematically perfect algorithm** that guarantees it will never lose. The best outcome you can achieve is a draw.

### **How It Works: Minimax Algorithm**

The AI uses the **minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**, the gold standard for perfect play in turn-based games:

- **🔍 Perfect Lookahead**: Analyzes every possible game state to the end
- **🎯 Optimal Decision Making**: Always chooses the mathematically best move
- **⚡ Efficient Processing**: Alpha-beta pruning eliminates unnecessary calculations
- **🛡️ Defensive Excellence**: Blocks all threats and prevents all forks
- **⚔️ Strategic Offense**: Creates winning opportunities when possible

### **Algorithm Details**

```dart
// Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
static _MinimaxResult _minimax(List<String> board, int depth, bool isMaximizing, int alpha, int beta) {
  // Evaluate terminal states
  if (checkWinner(board)) {
    return isMaximizing ? 
      _MinimaxResult(-1, -10 + depth) :  // Computer loses (bad)
      _MinimaxResult(-1, 10 - depth);   // Computer wins (good)
  }
  
  if (isBoardFull(board)) {
    return _MinimaxResult(-1, 0); // Draw (neutral)
  }
  
  // Recursively evaluate all possible moves...
}
```

**Scoring System:**
- `+10`: Computer wins (prefer faster wins)
- `-10`: Computer loses (delay losses)
- `0`: Draw (acceptable outcome)
- **Depth penalty**: Encourages winning quickly and losing slowly

## 🎮 Game Features

### **Core Gameplay**
- **Player vs Computer**: You're X, Computer is O
- **Unbeatable AI**: Computer will never lose
- **Strategic Turn Order**: Winner of previous game goes second
- **Auto-restart**: 3-second countdown between games

### **Visual Enhancements**
- **Winning Line Animation**: Highlights the winning combination
- **Color-coded Messages**: 
  - Blue for player ("Your Turn", "You win!")
  - Red for computer ("Computer's Turn", "Computer wins!")
  - Black for neutral ("It's a draw!", countdown text)
- **Smart Text Sizing**: Win messages prominent, countdown text subtle
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks wins, losses, and ties

### **Custom App Icon**
- Unique tic-tac-toe board design
- Platform-specific icons (Android, iOS, Web)
- Generated programmatically with Flutter

## 📱 Platform Support

- **🌐 Web**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **📱 Android**: Android 5.0+ (API 21+)
- **🍎 iOS**: iOS 11.0+
- **🖥️ Desktop**: Windows, macOS, Linux

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Flutter SDK 3.32.8+
- Dart 3.8.1+
- Platform-specific development tools

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/burkelashell109/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on your preferred platform
flutter run -d chrome        # Web
flutter run -d android       # Android
flutter run -d ios          # iOS
```

## 🎯 Try to Beat the AI!

### **Common Strategies That Won't Work:**
- **Fork attempts**: AI detects and prevents all forks
- **Corner traps**: AI uses optimal opening responses
- **Pattern exploitation**: AI doesn't fall for repetitive strategies

### **What You Can Achieve:**
- **Best case**: Force a draw with perfect play
- **Reality**: Computer will likely win most games
- **Learning**: Improve your tic-tac-toe strategy against perfection

### **Game State Management**
- **Immutable board evaluation**: AI doesn't modify actual game state
- **Efficient tree traversal**: Pruning eliminates ~75% of calculations
- **Depth-based scoring**: Encourages strategic tempo

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Alpha-beta pruning**: Reduces computation time significantly
- **Early termination**: Stops evaluation when optimal move found
- **Memory efficient**: No persistent game tree storage
